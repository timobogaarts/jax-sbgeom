# jax-sbgeom

A JAX-based Python package for stellarator geometry

# Installation
The jax dependency

PyVista is used in the examples with jupyter notebooks but is not a necessary dependency.

To use the examples:
```
pip install 'jupyterlab' 'pyvista[all]'
```


# Tests
Tests use SBGeom itself to verify against.
